We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or

Slack and GitHub. The DATA 551 teaching team are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.
