## Group 14 Teamwork Contract

To advance teamwork and communication, we have created this collaboration agreement to define how we will work together.

2. The meetings are planned to have a duration of 2 hours.      
3. All group members will be punctual. Meetings will start 10 minutes after the agreed start time and everyone should be there and ready by then.       
4. We should attend all meetings unless there are unavoidable events such as illnesses.        
5. All group members will remain in the meeting until (a) all tasks for that meeting are completed, or (b) there is unanimous adjournment.

1. Every team member will be responsible to solve the conflicts in GitHub when merging to the main branch.          
2. The group attempts to communicate using Slack to share ideas, improvements or any other resources that can be helpful for the development of the dashboard. Furtheremore, all group members have the right to express their point of view in person after classes, during lab time and all meetings. 
3. All group members will come to the meetings prepared by (a) reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and (b) coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
4. Tasks that group members agree to undertake should be completed to the agreed deadline. If it looks as though there will be a problem meeting a deadline, the person concerned should seek help from other members of the team in time to avoid a delay.

6. To effectively achieve the results, a group member will send the day’s agenda for each meeting one day before the meeting.

1. Roles will be assigned prior to a meeting or, if this is not possible, at the beginning of a meeting. Roles will rotate each meeting.

3. The secretary is responsible for taking in-session notes and preparing presentation materials from these notes.
